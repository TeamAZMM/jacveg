                            Today, Dan Hanley of The Gay Vegans is joining us to share his vegan story.  I randomly discovered with The Gay Vegans a few months before I went to Vida Vegan Con.  Dan’s compassion and drive is so touching, it was hard not to fall in love with the blog immediately.
                            Then on the first morning of Vida Vegan Con, Chris and I met Dan and we could not get over the amount of love and kindness and positivity that this man exudes.  His warm smile feels like a big, comforting hug.  A couple months later, Chris and I were lucky enough to meet up with Dan and his equally warm and friendly husband, Mike, on their Southern California vacation and we had an epic meal at Crossroads in West Hollywood.

                            It’s time for another vegan story!  Today, I am so excited to have the delightful, incredible, and dare I say sparkly Rebecca Weller (though many of you know her as “Bex”) of one of my favorite blogs, Vegan Sparkles! 
                            If you’ve visited her blog you know how she radiates warmth and positivity, which is what drew me to her in the first place.  I stayed for all of the delicious food!  I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Bex and her equally wonderful significant other while she was on holiday here in the U.S. and I can honestly say she is one of the most positive, happy people I’ve ever met.
